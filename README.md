This To-Do List app is built using Jetpack Compose and provides a seamless experience for managing daily tasks.
The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks efficiently. 
Each task is stored in a local Room Database, ensuring that the data persists across sessions.
When a user adds a new task, it is instantly saved to the Room Database, and any task deletion is also reflected in the database.
